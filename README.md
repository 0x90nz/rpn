RPN calculators in different languages

If I want to get a feeling for a language, my current go-to exercise is an RPN
calculator. It's a good mix of I/O and simple data structures that I find is
small enough to be achievable in an afternoon, even in a completely unfamiliar
language, but not too small as to fail to give a feel for the language.

For some of these, this code will be the first time I've ever used the language,
so there's a fair bit of piecing together. Some are also quite old, and so might
not represent my current ability in the language.

The goal of these are to be a small learning exercise for each language, so
dependent on the language features like an infinite input buffer, or nice error
messages aren't really within scope for this.
